## Overview

Orion is a newly introduced Space Tank character in Galactic Defender known for his impressive defensive capabilities and strong area-of-effect attacks. As a 6-star character, he is featured in the latest event banner of version 3.1. Orion's ability to absorb damage and counterattack makes him a valuable asset in any team setup.

## Equipment

### Stellar Shield

- Increases Orion’s Defense by 70%. When Orion receives damage, there is a 30% chance to reflect 50% of the damage back to the attacker.
- Ideal for tanking and counterattacking enemies. Available from the event shop.

### Nebula Cleaver

- Grants a 20% increase in Orion’s attack speed. Additionally, each successful hit reduces the enemy’s armor by 15% for 2 turns.
- A great alternative to enhance Orion's offensive capabilities. Can be obtained through special missions.

### Cosmic Armor

- Boosts Orion’s overall defense by 40%. When activated, grants a 10% chance to dodge incoming attacks.
- Provides decent defense but lacks the additional effects of the top-tier equipment.

## Ultimate and Abilities

When Orion activates his ultimate, he transforms into a formidable space juggernaut, unleashing a powerful energy wave that deals massive damage and shields allies for a few turns. His skill, "Galactic Crush," deals damage to all enemies in range, while his basic attack, "Star Slash," delivers consistent damage with a chance to stun.
